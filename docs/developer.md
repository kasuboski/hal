## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
Completed the setup of the project structure, implemented the crawler component, implemented the processor component, implemented the index manager component, implemented the search system component, and implemented the CLI interface component. The crawler can now crawl websites, extract content, clean HTML, and convert it to Markdown. The processor can chunk Markdown content, generate embeddings, and integrate with the LLM for summaries and context. The index manager can store and retrieve websites and chunks from the database. The search system can perform vector similarity search on the indexed content and return relevant results. The CLI interface provides commands for crawling, indexing, searching, and listing websites. Unit tests have been added for the crawler, processor, and search components to ensure the functionality works as expected.

### Decisions Made
1. **Web Crawling Implementation**: Initially attempted to use the spider crate for web crawling, but encountered compatibility issues with the API. Decided to implement a custom crawler using reqwest directly, which gives us more control over the crawling process and is easier to integrate with our existing code.

2. **HTML Cleaning Approach**: Implemented a simplified HTML cleaning approach that uses string manipulation instead of DOM manipulation, as the scraper crate doesn't provide easy methods for DOM manipulation. This approach is more straightforward but may not handle all edge cases perfectly.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting using tokio::time::sleep to avoid overwhelming servers. This is a simple approach but effective for most cases.

4. **Markdown Chunking**: Implemented a simple Markdown chunking algorithm that splits text based on size and tries to preserve headings. The algorithm uses the pulldown_cmark crate to parse Markdown and extract headings.

5. **Embedding Generation**: Used the existing Gemini API client to generate embeddings for text chunks. This approach leverages the existing code and avoids having to implement a separate embedding API client.

6. **LLM Integration**: Used the existing Gemini API client to generate summaries and context strings for text chunks. This approach leverages the existing code and avoids having to implement a separate LLM API client.

7. **Database Schema**: Designed a simple database schema with two main tables: websites and chunks. The websites table stores metadata about crawled websites, while the chunks table stores the actual content chunks with their embeddings. Used LibSQL for the database, which provides a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve data.

8. **Website Metadata Management**: Implemented a simple website metadata management system that tracks when websites were last crawled, how many pages were indexed, and the status of the website. This allows for efficient recrawling of websites based on a configurable frequency.

9. **Vector Search Implementation**: Implemented vector search using LibSQL's JSON functions to calculate similarity between embeddings. This approach avoids the need for a separate vector database and leverages the existing database infrastructure. The search system supports filtering by source domain and date range, and returns results sorted by relevance.

10. **Search Result Processing**: Implemented search result processing that extracts relevant information from the database and formats it for display. The search system returns structured results that include the chunk text, summary, context, URL, and other metadata.

11. **Dependency Updates**: Updated the libsql dependency from version 0.2.0 to 0.6.0 to take advantage of the latest features and improvements, particularly the async API for better performance and resource utilization.

12. **CLI Interface**: Implemented a CLI interface using the Clap crate, which provides a clean and intuitive way to interact with the system. The CLI supports commands for crawling websites, indexing content, searching for information, and listing indexed websites. Each command has appropriate options and arguments to customize its behavior.

13. **Unit Testing**: Added unit tests for the crawler, processor, and search components to ensure the functionality works as expected. The tests cover basic functionality like HTML cleaning, metadata handling, chunking, and search options. More comprehensive tests would require mocking the database and external APIs.

14. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the codebase, particularly in the database operations. Used the thiserror crate to define custom error types and implemented From traits to convert between error types. This makes it easier to propagate errors and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

### Next Steps
The next step is to optimize performance of the RAG feature. This will involve profiling the code to identify bottlenecks and implementing optimizations to improve performance. Potential areas for optimization include the database operations, the chunking algorithm, and the embedding generation process.
