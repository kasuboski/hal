title: MDC Rules Location
description: Specifies that new MDC rules should be created in the .cursor/rules directory
---

When creating new MDC (Model-Driven Code) rules:
- All new rules should be created in the `.cursor/rules` directory
- Each rule should be in its own separate file
- Files should use the `.md` extension
- Files should follow the MDC rule format with YAML frontmatter

This ensures consistent organization and maintainability of MDC rules across the project.
